### Hello!  This is my Intro to _MAGD_ class GitHub for **2024**!

I  included three of my past assignments in the course during my first semester at UW Whitewater. The three examples I have are...

* What a Day!
* GradientFill Example
* Lab Homework #4

Each of these was created in p5.js.
The first was an experiment with images and text while tracking the mouse cursor.
The second was another experiment of downloading and working with outside p5.js libraries.
The last lab assignment was an early test of p5.js of animation and shapes.
